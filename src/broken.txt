Experiments Mesh
----------------

* Software 3D
	+ Few of it is very broken. But it's mostly software rendering on CEL, both for 8bpp and 16bpp CEL bitmaps.
	  However one of the modes might have been trying to do gouraud with CEL gradients combined. Or, recently I have been altering the software rendering and may have broke something.
	  NOTE: This is broken even on 3DO, I was messing up with the software renderer, probably not a problem on the 3DO CEL emulation

Experiments Packed
------------------

* Packed Rain
	+ Unpacked now works, packed displays nothing

* Packed Wave
	+ Junk displayed (also crashes on release)

Experiments Sprites
-------------------

* Paralax Tests
	+ grass is still broken (packed texture and some offset?)

* AMV bits
	+ Obviously not implemented yet on the CEL renderer. Sprite moves but no antialiased blends around the pixels, just solid. Didn't bother as I rarely use AMV bits in my own projects.
