// For some reason, those 3 defines below were in the header file like all the other experiment main3DO
// But of I move this one it has linker issues and that's normal as they use the same name (but why doesn't it happen with all the rest?)
// Anyway that's only because I was pressing F7 and building everything at once. If you do Ctrl+B after you set one of the projects as StartUp, it only builds that and it's ok.
// Which means I could move them back in their header, but I will be confused and press F7 and lose half of my hour, but also in the original 3DO they are in the header so I am not changing it for all the others.
// I want to keep the code as faithful as the original and maybe I should move those also to the header and just remember to press Ctrl+B and not just try to build all at once but only the selected project.
